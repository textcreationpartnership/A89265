         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OUr Army marched out of <hi>Dublin Aug.</hi> 1. inſtant under command of Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, 4000. horſe and foot, with two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miculverins, and five Field-peeces; our men as well armed as we could, and what powder, bullet and Amunition could be ſpared from the City, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered about <hi>Port, Caſtle-Knocke,</hi> and parts adjacent, but our foot and carriages, could not goe farre that night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 2. We marched into the County of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi> where we had advertiſements by Scouts ſent out by Collonel <hi>Jones,</hi> that <hi>Maynoth</hi> Caſtle was ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to <hi>Preſton,</hi> and that Sir <hi>Henry Titchburn</hi> had been ſurpriſed by 3 Troops of the Rebells, and that ſome Gentlemen and officers of note; the Rebells re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing

to give quarter, which did much raiſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our Souldiers againſt them: The Rebells had fetched ſome prey from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſent out parties to plunder other places, and we tooke that day ſome priſoners. <hi>A</hi> Councell of War was called, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 3. Wee had intelligence that <hi>Preſton</hi> had raiſed his ſiege from before <hi>Trim,</hi> and that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to march towards <hi>Portleſter,</hi> and that the number of his horſe and foot were about 8000. and that there were divers Lords and Commoners of the generall Aſſembly of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> in the army, who were as Commiſſio<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4. 2000. foot, and 600. horſe were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us, the Britiſh, Collonel <hi>Coot,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Titchburne</hi> being joyned with us, which made up our number about 7000. horſe and foot, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to a generall Randezvouz. That day we had a confirmation of the certainty of <hi>Preſtons</hi> Army drawing off, and what was before advertiſed, and the whole Army was put into a poſture, and in our march we found, that many Papiſts Gentlemen that are Iriſh inhabitants left their houſes, and were gone to the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:114462:3"/>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 5. A Councell of war was called, And it was reſolved to give battell to <hi>Preſtons</hi> Army if they would fight, if not to purſue them, and a commanded party was appointed to take the carriages, and put re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe into <hi>Trim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. VVe marched towards Trim, from whence the Rebells were not gone far, ſo that wee gave them an alarme, whereupon Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> drew his Army towards the Kings County to impede <hi>Preſtons</hi> marching toward Kilkenny, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout forty miles diſtance from them, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Jones</hi> intended to drive them Northward or fight them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 7. Both Armies faced, and drew into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia neare Linceyes Knocke, and both parties planted their Ordnance, and ordered their bodies, <hi>Preſton</hi> being reſolved only to defend, but Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> was reſolved to fall upon them if they advanced not the next day, and that night ſome Scouts met, and our horſe brought in ſome of their cattell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 8. Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> ſent out a forlorne hope which did ſcrimiſh with them, but the Rebells had a very great advantage in the ground from which they would not move. But Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> had given order for the battell, which was very hot and ſharp, as you may ſee by the incloſed liſt of thoſe ſlaine and taken priſoners.</p>
            <p>This was a day wherein the Kingdome of Ireland was at the ſtake to be won or loſt; but God be praiſed who hath given his ſervants the victory, and given ſtrength to our Forces totally to defeat that great and bloody Army.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Jones</hi> fought ſo deſperately, that wee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114462:4"/>
were in continuall feare of his life, and would by no meanes be perſwaded, but ruſhed upon the Rebells with ſuch courage, that it put a mighty ſpirit into the whole Army; he ſlew many of the Rebells officers and others.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Kings</hi> ſon did brave ſervice, killed the Rebells Lieutenant generall of horſe with his owne hands, and divers others: and to ſpeake uprightly, Col. <hi>Long,</hi> and ſo all our officers and ſouldiers, did ſo good ſervice, and fought with ſo much ſpirit and courage, as ever I ſaw an Army, or could be expected from them.</p>
            <p>Had the loſſe been ours, <hi>Ireland</hi> had been loſt, God giving us the day (in which the Rebells are totally routed) now this Kingdome may be ſaved (through Gods bleſſing) if ſupplies come ſpeedily from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>As for his Excellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> I know that nothing will be wanting from that Army, if they have but encouragement and aſſiſtance, monies and Amunition provided, for naked men cannot help us.</p>
            <p>VVe are ſtill in purſuit of the Rebells, and take priſoners. I am very weary, and ſo we are all; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire your Lordſhips to accept of this account from</p>
